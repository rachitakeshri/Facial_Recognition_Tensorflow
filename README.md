# Facial_Recognition_Tensorflow


This is a facial expression recognition  flask app made using Keras,Tensorflow . It is a emotion recognition model using CNN.
It is build on 4 layers of Convolution Neural Network (CNN), uses cv2 to process videos and return the square marked faces.
It is an introductory level model for understanding the concept of neural networks, emotion recognition and basics of Flask.
Emotions used are happy,sad,neutral,anger, disgust and fear.
The callbacks are based on accuracy as well as learning rate.

Data set is already divided into training and testing folders.

The same project is accessible on coursera as a guided project.

For running this file in local system, you have to implicitly install livelossplots ( to plot live loss or accuracy of every epoch):https://github.com/stared/livelossplot
All other libraries used are common: tensorflow,seaborn,cv2(opencv) etc
